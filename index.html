<strong>Rolling Today</strong>



<strong>You. not me. (9 feb 2026)</strong>

your eyes of glass  
transparent sight  
a voided gaze  
towards the light  

find yourself  
before another  
or life will loop  
an endless fight  

grasp your soul  
an ancient ruin  
before you act  
connect the pieces  

solve the puzzle  
a wonder ceases  



<strong>Persisting Perception (10 feb 2026)</strong>

by one, by two, by three, by four  
i won't be there to shut the door  
a shallow screach  
a hollow cry  
i musn't die by suicide  

a candle lit, its pointing at me  
a flame of sin awake inside  

but who defines the sin i ask  
law and order  
history, past  

brought here without will, i was  
now bound by morals, sin and task  

liquid truth, forensic fire  
its cordial thoughts, actions and desire  

by five, by six, by seven, by eight  
a failed attempt to close the gate  

aligning patterns  
static shapes  
but crystal clear  
no light escapes  

pinpoint stars, like burning gass  
not the normal tone of grass  

the preaching fingers wrap around me  
a wave of pure dispair upon me  
a soul with nothing left inside me  

by nine, by ten, by thought, by timing  
a resting baby softly crying  

the ancious mind that never rests  
vision full, a thousand pests
